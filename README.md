# Vulnerability Scanner Tool

This vulnerability scanner tool is designed to identify security vulnerabilities in various services such as Apache, MySQL, WordPress, and MongoDB. It retrieves version information for these services, looks up relevant CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), and generates a PDF report detailing the vulnerabilities found.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Download and Extract the Source Code**

   Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory on your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
   Install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Services**

   Ensure that Docker is installed on your system. You can set up each service using Docker containers.

   - **Apache:**

     Run the following command to start an Apache container:

     ```
     docker run -d -p 201:80 --name my-apache httpd
     ```

     This command starts an Apache container named `my-apache` on port 201.

   - **MySQL:**

     Before running the script, set the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable with the MySQL root password:

     ```
     export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-password>
     ```

     Replace `<your-password>` with your desired root password.

     Then, run the following command to start a MySQL container:

     ```
     docker run -d -p 301:3306 --name my-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD mysql
     ```

     This command starts a MySQL container named `my-mysql` on port 301.

   - **WordPress:**

     Run the following command to start a WordPress container:

     ```
     docker run -d -p 401:80 --name my-wordpress wordpress
     ```

     This command starts a WordPress container named `my-wordpress` on port 401.

   - **MongoDB:**

     Run the following command to start a MongoDB container:

     ```
     docker run -d -p 501:27017 --name my-mongodb mongo
     ```

     This command starts a MongoDB container named `my-mongodb` on port 501.

4. **Configure Services**

   Edit the `input.json` file to specify the services you want to scan. Each service should include the following fields:

   - `ip`: IP address of the server hosting the service.
   - `port`: Port number on which the service is running.
   - `base_url`: Base URL for accessing the service.
   - `service_type`: Type of service (e.g., Apache, MySQL, WordPress, MongoDB).

   Example:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "ip": "127.0.0.1",
       "port": 80,
       "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1/",
       "service_type": "Apache"
     },
     {
       "ip": "127.0.0.1",
       "port": 3306,
       "base_url": "http://127.0.0.1/",
       "service_type": "MySQL"
     }
   ]
   ```

## Usage

Before running the `main.py` script, ensure that the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable is set:

export MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<your-password>

Then, you can run the script to initiate the vulnerability scanning process:
`python main.py`

The script will retrieve version information for each service, lookup vulnerabilities, and generate a PDF report for each service. After running the tests, a PDF file will be generated for each service run, named with their service type and version.

## Adding a new Module

To add a new module, follow these steps:

1. **Implement the Version Retrieval Function:**
   Develop a function to retrieve the version of the new service.
   Utilize appropriate methods such as HTTP requests, APIs, or metadata access for fetching version information.
   Ensure robust error handling in case version retrieval encounters failures.
2. **Update Main Script:**
   Integrate the new module within the get_service_version function alongside existing service retrieval mechanisms.
3. **Test Integration:**
   Validate the integration of the new module by executing the main.py script with test data or within a dedicated test environment.
4. **Document Changes:**
   Document all modifications, including the incorporation of the new module and any added dependencies in the requirements.txt file.
